# Fractal-Tree

This is a simple drawing animation that uses recursive calls to draw a tree from the trunk out.
The animation is quite fun because you can see the order the program processes each branch for the tree and in order can see all of the branches printed out.

<h2>The Program</h2>

The program works by taking in a user input and using some math on it to calculate the size of the tree and how long the recursive process for drawing will take.

When the user inputs a number, the tree is instantly created with all of its branches. The program then takes a timer and uses it to increment through printing all of the branches.
